## More Technical Explanation

#### Easy UI Nav

This script, `Easy_UI_Nav`, is designed to simplify UI navigation in Unity. Let's break down its components:

1. **Public Variables**:
   - `NavName`: A string variable to hold the name of the navigation.
   - `navs`: A list of `UINavigator` objects. Each `UINavigator` represents a UI navigation setup.

2. **UINavigator Class**:
   - `UserChosenButton`: A reference to the button that triggers the navigation.
   - `ItemsToEnable`: A list of game objects to enable when the button is clicked.
   - `ItemsToDisable`: A list of game objects to disable when the button is clicked.
   - The constructor initializes these properties.

3. **Awake Method**:
   - Iterates through each `UINavigator` in the `navs` list.
   - Adds listeners to the `UserChosenButton` of each `UINavigator`.
   - When the button is clicked, it enables objects in `ItemsToEnable` and disables objects in `ItemsToDisable`.

4. **EnableAll and DisableAll Methods**:
   - Enable or disable all game objects in the provided lists.

5. **RunMethods Method**:
   - Not currently used in the provided script.

6. **ObservedList Class**:
   - A generic list implementation with additional events for tracking changes.
   - It provides functionality similar to `ObservableCollection` in C#. Becomes more important in 1.2.

7. **Custom Editor (`Easy_UI_NavEditor`)**:
   - Extends the Unity `Editor` class to customize the appearance of `Easy_UI_Nav` in the Unity Inspector.
   - Provides a button to clear the lists of `ItemsToEnable` and `ItemsToDisable` for each `UINavigator` when clicked.

8. **KeyValue Class**:
   - A generic class to hold key-value pairs, used for serialization purposes.

Overall, this script facilitates UI navigation by allowing you to define button-click behaviors that enable/disable specific UI elements associated with each button. The ObservedList class adds functionality to track changes to lists, and the custom editor provides a convenient way to manage UI navigation setups within the Unity Editor.
